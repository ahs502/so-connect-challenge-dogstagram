## Important notes

A live version of the application is served under [this address](https://???.zettel.ai).

You may use any arbitrary ***User ID*** to sign in.

The ***Password*** is hard-coded to **`"zoot"`**.

The UI is pretty responsive, so it works fine on different screen sizes.

## Technical stack

- TypeScript
- React
- MUI
- Webpack (Create-React-App)

> It's strongly recommended to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to develope this repository.

## Development guide

Thanks to the `husky` package, every changes are checked before being committed.
This includes linting and testing.
Therefore, in order to have a convenient committing experience, you may do both checks manually right before committing to make sure everthing is alright:

```sh
$ npm run lint-stage   # Do not forget to stage changes first!
$ npm test
```
